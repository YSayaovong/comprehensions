# Employee Data Mapping with Python Comprehensions

This project demonstrates the use of Python comprehensions and the `map()` function to process employee data. It includes generating usernames, modifying lists, and mapping employee initials to their IDs using dictionary comprehension.

## Overview

The project is based on a fictional list of employees from "Little Lemon" company. The tasks include:
- Creating usernames from employee names and departments.
- Storing modified data in a list using the `map()` function.
- Mapping employee initials to their unique IDs using dictionary comprehension.

## Lab Objectives

The main goals of this lab are:
1. **Apply the `map()` function** to modify list elements.
2. **Use list comprehension** to generate modified data.
3. **Utilize dictionary comprehension** to map specific key-value pairs.
4. **Handle string manipulations** like replacing spaces with underscores.

## Getting Started
